The CSS property `content` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not used carefully.  For example, using `content` with `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements without specifying a value may lead to unexpected results or inconsistencies across browsers.

Another potential issue is related to specificity when using generated content.  If specificity conflicts arise between selectors targeting the generated content and other elements, it might lead to unpredictable styling.

Incorrectly using `attr()` function within the `content` property, particularly with complex attributes or non-existent attributes can trigger errors or unwanted rendering issues.
